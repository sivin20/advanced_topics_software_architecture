\section{Problem and Approach}

\label{sec:problem}

The problem addressed in this research is addressing how one could design an architecture for a beer bottle factory. This includes a production system that satisfies the requirements of high availability, continuous deployability, and interoperability, in alignment with Industry 4.0 principles.

\emph{Research Questions.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can we design an architecture that complies with the Industry 4.0 quality attributes of availability, interoperability, and deployability?
    \item What are the architectural trade-offs and challenges associated with the operational complexity in a distributed Industry 4.0 production system?
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Approach.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Systematic Literature Review:}\\
    Review existing I4.0 architectures, production system requirements, and relevant case studies in a systematic litterature review, as described by Keele et al. \cite{keele2007guidelines}
    \item \textbf{Unfolding the Problem with a Use Case:}\\
    Employ a use case to describe the specific challenges and demands faced by a beer bottle factory, setting the stage for crafting a tailored architecture.
    \item \textbf{Define Requirements Using Quality Attribute Scenarios:}\\
    Identify and describe requirements based on Quality Attribute Scenarios, particularly emphasizing high availability, continuous deployability, and interoperability.
    \item \textbf{Develop Conceptual Model:}\\
    Create a conceptual model that embodies the architectural structure and elements essential for the beer bottle factory.
    \item \textbf{Prototype and Case Study:}\\
    Develop a prototype for real-world testing around the concept of the beer bottle factory.
    \item \textbf{Evaluation and Optimization:}\\
    Assess performance, optimize, and refine the model and architecture choices based on feedback and KPIs.
\end{enumerate}

By addressing this problem of creating a beer bottling factory through the proposed approach, the research aims to provide an architecture solution that effectively caters to the production systems needs, ensuring seamless, efficient operations in the beer bottle factory within the context of Industry 4.0.
