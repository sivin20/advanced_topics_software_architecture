\section{Conclusion}

In this report, we have described the process of creating an architecture for an industry 4.0 production system producing bottled beer. To solve such a  challenge, we have created and proposed a service oriented distributed solution, to comply with general industry 4.0 quality attributes which are availability, interoperability and deployability. By using a service oriented architecture, individual services can be updated without disturbing others using different strategies, and can also be implemented in different languages, as long as the comply with predefined interfaces. The distributed nature allows routing production away from potential unavailable components of the production system. Trade-offs in the system come in forms of complexity. Running in a distributed way also means more machines, which means more operational complexity. Generally when computation is spread out, it opens more fault surfaces. Often however, the magnitude of each fault surface is reduced. As out experiments showed, our solution fulfills the requirements of our system and our most important quality attribute which is correctness.
